# dots-hyprland

A personal fork of [End-4's top-notch dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland). This is mostly intended for my personal use, but feel free to use it if you like the small changes I make!

Current customizations in this repo:
- Taskbar mousewheel volume adjustments set to 5% and capped to 100% to match keyboard volume behavior
- Changed Arch update command in the Tools dropdown to `yay --noconfirm`
- Disabled timed hypridle automatic lock / monitor power-off / system suspend (these can be triggered manually)
- Sources `~/.fish-config` to allow customizing fish shell outside the `~/.config/fish/` directory to preserve customizations during reinstall
